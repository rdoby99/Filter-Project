# Filter-Project
from JS-Beginners at https://github.com/JS-Beginners/mortgage-loan-calculator.git

HTML&CSS not mine. I wrote the code in app.js after viewing the solution.

This project focused on coding the filter that sorts through the sale items at the bottom of the page.

## What I Learned

I was excited to try this project because my portfolio required a similar section where I could filter through items. I let my curiosity get the best of me, and looked at the solution after only writing about ten lines of code. I was headed in the right direction, writing an immediately invoked function, storing the buttons and items in variables, looping through then with a forEach, and adding an event listener to each one. However, after I did that I looked at the solution to see how to do the rest.

The `.target` and `.dataset` methods were new to me, as well as the `.contains` and `.includes` methods.



## Biggest Takeaways/Reminders
- `.target`, `.dataset`, `.contains`, `.trim`, and `.includes` methods.
